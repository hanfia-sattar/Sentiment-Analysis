ohboop,"Academics are starting to talk about the possibility of something called an ""affective filter"". Basically the idea, as I understand it, is that our brains have a *really* hard time learning a new language when we're stressed out or otherwise feeling negative about it. I wouldn't be surprised if your brain is having this issue, based on what you've described here.


That being said, I think it would really help to build up some positive experiences for yourself. Start with some things you think you could accomplish more or less easily. Maybe a journal where you write a few sentences each day along the lines of ""I like coffee. Today the weather is rainy."" Keep it basic, and focus on being happy with what you can do, not upset about what you can't. Read, watch and listen to things that you can understand easily, and focus on the positive feelings of being able to understand, *not* on things like, ""this is below where I should be"".


Besides that, I would recommend trying to find some structure you can follow. It sounds like your class was a positive experience. If taking another class is not an option, what about something self-paced, like assimil, Pimsleur, or another course book? Pimsleur in particular is focused on getting you to listen and respond automatically. They go slowly and reviews are built in to each successive lesson, so it could be a great course for you.


Lastly, you need to communicate with your partner that his attitude towards your learning is upsetting for you, and it can make it hard to keep trying. Ask if he would be open to working together on how he can support you. ""I like it when you do X"" or ""it makes me feel bad when you say things like Y"". Positive feedback is a much better motivator than negative, which tends to demoralize and demotivate people.",9,1727725288.0,academics starting talk possibility something called affective filter basically idea understand brains really hard time learning new language stressed otherwise feeling negative wouldnt surprised brain issue based youve described said think would really help build positive experiences start things think could accomplish less easily maybe journal write sentences day along lines like coffee today weather rainy keep basic focus happy upset cant read watch listen things understand easily focus positive feelings able understand things like besides would recommend trying find structure follow sounds like class positive experience taking another class option something selfpaced like assimil pimsleur another course book pimsleur particular focused getting listen respond automatically go slowly reviews built successive lesson could great course lastly need communicate partner attitude towards learning upsetting make hard keep trying ask would open working together support like x makes feel bad say things like positive feedback much better motivator negative tends demoralize demotivate people

LucreziaD,"Ok, I am native speaker of Italian and I have several foreign languages under my belt. First, struggling to learn a language doesn't mean to be a failure.

Please keep in mind these things:

* learning a language requires a lot of time. Fluency requires hundreds of hours of structured learning and even more of exposure to the language. Yes, some people are faster than others, but especially if you have never learned a foreign language before it requires extra time.
* Passive abilities (reading and then listening) usually develop before active ones (speaking and writing). So again, perfectly normal that you struggle. 
* Level A1 is basic survival level: how not to die of hunger and thirst if you are stranded in Italy with nobody who speaks English. If you want to be able to have a normal conversation, you need to take classes up to level B1 for  everyday interactions, and B2 for more complex interactions. C1 is the level where you can talk about anything with little effort. So yes, one A1 curse is not going to solve your problem unfortunately.
* Your partner acting like a dick when you are trying to speak is the most stupid thing ever. Teaching a language requires a lot of patience and encouragement. Becoming impatient and making you feel stupid isn't helping anyone.

Then I don't know you and your learning styles, but I can tell you what tricks were useful for me. Maybe some will be useful to you too.

* Going full immersion. Set your phone, your tablet, your computer to Italian. All social medias, podcasts, tv, newspapers, books, music, etc, all should be in Italian. No English media at all. Surround yourself with Italian and Italian only. Just get a good italian-english dictionary for when you can't figure out the meaning of words. 
* Children's books. Reading is always easier than listening. Children's books are especially easy and cover the basic everyday language. Go to your local library and start from the books for the youngest (the ones soon you will start showing to your baby) and read your way from there. 
* Grammar. This I know is a controversial topic, but Italian is a much richly inflected language than English (especially the verbs). A good grammar with exercises (a paper book) can be a very useful tool. Learning the grammar of a language teaches you its structure. Knowing the structure makes parsing written sentences easier.   Better reading skill help you improving your vocabulary, making recognizing word boundaries when people speak easier. Better understanding of conversations will, after enough input, make it easier for you to formulate full sentences.
* If you can get a tutor, working on the sounds of a language and how to correctly articulate them is really useful.  For instance to articulate the Italian t, you need to put the tip of your tongue in a different position than to articulate an English t. If it isn't possible, there are books and youtube videos with this kind of explanations. 
* Look if you can do some kind of exchange language activity, like finding Italians who want to practice speaking in English in exchange of them helping you practice speaking Italian. Since you are both learning it can be a less stressful environment than trying to talk to strangers in a shop or with your partner.",4,1727725206.0,ok native speaker italian several foreign languages belt first struggling learn language doesnt mean failure please keep mind things learning language requires lot time fluency requires hundreds hours structured learning even exposure language yes people faster others especially never learned foreign language requires extra time passive abilities reading listening usually develop active ones speaking writing perfectly normal struggle level basic survival level die hunger thirst stranded italy nobody speaks english want able normal conversation need take classes level b everyday interactions b complex interactions c level talk anything little effort yes one curse going solve problem unfortunately partner acting like dick trying speak stupid thing ever teaching language requires lot patience encouragement becoming impatient making feel stupid isnt helping anyone dont know learning styles tell tricks useful maybe useful going full immersion set phone tablet computer italian social medias podcasts tv newspapers books music etc italian english media surround italian italian get good italianenglish dictionary cant figure meaning words childrens books reading always easier listening childrens books especially easy cover basic everyday language go local library start books youngest ones soon start showing baby read way grammar know controversial topic italian much richly inflected language english especially verbs good grammar exercises paper book useful tool learning grammar language teaches structure knowing structure makes parsing written sentences easier better reading skill help improving vocabulary making recognizing word boundaries people speak easier better understanding conversations enough input make easier formulate full sentences get tutor working sounds language correctly articulate really useful instance articulate italian need put tip tongue different position articulate english isnt possible books youtube videos kind explanations look kind exchange language activity like finding italians want practice speaking english exchange helping practice speaking italian since learning less stressful environment trying talk strangers shop partner

justHoma,"How I plan to teach European languages: 

- Use Anki for cards: n+1 sentence or tl(target language)/nl(native language) (or explanation if level allows)   
- Spend time learning key differences from the nl, for example in Italian first thing is 3 golden tenses (same as in English), and then it can be easily scaled on others. [https://ankiweb.net/](https://ankiweb.net/)  
- Read read read, a lot of people don't know how powerful this activity is, especially if you read out loud. Something that you want to say comes to your mind, and lots of times main construction is correct. Use lingq to be able to read advanced things without caring about words (I usually read Harry Potter and Methods of Rationality). For example in when I read it in Italian it has so much new words per page that I would read with speed of 5-7 words/minute if I googled each of them, instead, I read 40/minute.   
- When you have enough skill create a channel with just tl, the main point is to get listening fluency as fast as possible. I recommend choosing one topic and watch only channels that talk about it. This way you'll be able to get fluent really fast in this one field and scaling on other fields will be a breath.   
- Speaking. One of the easiest ways is to create an Anki deck for sentences you said wrong, if you said ""Io vivo nell Roma"" or something like that, just create card ""Io vivo a Roma"", and on the front page write ""I live in Rome"", after some time you'll start saying ""a"" for same cases (also you can include rule on the back on this card as well ""use a with cities"").

When you are making a program for yourself it should be balanced, interesting, and sure for your goals. 

For example, my method of learning Japanese might seem strange ""why would he learn so much grammar before and do only one hour of immersion a day"" but in reality I just have chosen to follow a challenge, where I can track my results and because of it I can stay motivated. Or Italian, where I just read because I don't want to do anything else and also want to test how exactly  it will work out. 

If you have some interest, you can dm me and maybe I'll create program for you) My motivation is whatever I do I should find a student after reaching some point, to see if my theories and methods are correct not just for me.",3,1727723110.0,plan teach european languages use anki cards n sentence tltarget languagenlnative language explanation level allows spend time learning key differences nl example italian first thing golden tenses english easily scaled others httpsankiwebnethttpsankiwebnet read read read lot people dont know powerful activity especially read loud something want say comes mind lots times main construction correct use lingq able read advanced things without caring words usually read harry potter methods rationality example read italian much new words per page would read speed wordsminute googled instead read minute enough skill create channel tl main point get listening fluency fast possible recommend choosing one topic watch channels talk way youll able get fluent really fast one field scaling fields breath speaking one easiest ways create anki deck sentences said wrong said io vivo nell roma something like create card io vivo roma front page write live rome time youll start saying cases also include rule back card well use cities making program balanced interesting sure goals example method learning japanese might seem strange would learn much grammar one hour immersion day reality chosen follow challenge track results stay motivated italian read dont want anything else also want test exactly work interest dm maybe ill create program motivation whatever find student reaching point see theories methods correct
Wild_Honeysuckle,"Are you taking lessons? You need to find a space to practice speaking (and listening etc) with someone patient, who can help teach you. That’s not your husband. 

Others have put forward good ideas. Personally, I quite like https://www.babbel.com/live. You can have as many live online video lessons as you like for a fixed price. If you’re willing to put the time in and take lots of lessons, the cost would be very reasonable. I quite like the group lessons, with up to 6 in a class, mostly because I don’t have to work as hard! Plus I quite like meeting a bunch of random people. But given you have a strong motivation to learn, you probably want to consider the private lessons. You’d get lots of practice at speaking, and would learn really quickly, I suspect. There’s also the Babbel app, with lessons that work well for my learning style. I find the app teaches me words and grammar, and the live lessons allow me to practice, and to learn to actually speak. It can all be done from home, which would help if your baby is due to arrive soon. 

Beyond that… I had a quick look at your previous posts. Your husband is 10 years older than you, and honestly sounds a bit nasty, at least on occasions. You’ve moved to his country away from your friends and family, I would guess. You have a baby on the way, which will be stressful (and delightful). There are some pretty serious red flags here.

iamnogoodatthis,"Your partner is probably your single biggest obstacle to learning Italian, when he could be your single biggest help. Once you've learned some simple vocabulary and grammar, the best way to learn is just to speak - and a big challenge of language learning is getting over the hump of being scared to just to say whatever you can cobble together even if you know it's not quite right. He is making this a pressurised, scary experience for you, which is exactly the opposite of what you need to actually learn anything. I'm sorry he's like this.

Taking a step back, why did you both move to Italy when you spoke not a word of Italian if he wasn't OK with that situation? He's an idiot if he was living in some fantasy whereby you'd just jump immediately to upper-intermediate fluency in a few months.

oeiei,"You guys need some friends who are in a similar boat so that he can feel like the situation is normal. Sometimes we get partners that are such conformists, and they need a little help. Ideal would be people who are similar to you guys but the English speaker is *slightly* further along so that they can give you guys advice on what works, but still normalize the situation.

IMO what works is being low key and relying primarily on immersion. You get your language lessons from other people, but at home it's low key immersion. (He should chat conversationally in a normal way in both Italian and English with you, just Italian whenever possible, but not say unnatural things like ""How do you say 'I am pouring milk in my tea?'""--that is for your language classes, he is not an instructor he is your partner.)But if he's not good at being low key about that, get your immersion from other people like a language chat group. Language classes are also good for structured learning, but both are best. Language chat group can overlap with meeting people as mentioned above.

Your child should get OPOL (I think that's the acronym). You'll keep picking it up. It's really not a big deal if your kid knows a language that you're not great at, just keep working at Italian for your own sake.

Pregnancy is going to involve baby brain and probably later sleep deprivation. Also once the baby is born, it's a bit of an emotional roller coaster at first--My spouse and I were both saying ""Why on earth do people think it's strange that new parents get PPD, this is a crazy-making time!"" so, your husband needs to get this issue sorted out for himself very soon in preparation for more important things.

I regret not doing OPOL from babyhood with my husband who resisted teaching our kids his language. Finally now he is motivated because I said our kids should at least be able to have the right accent, and that's something he relates to, so he's doing a bit better. He also struggles with not playing language teacher and instead just talking--I think it's a continental thing.",2,1727729338.0,guys need friends similar boat feel like situation normal sometimes get partners conformists need little help ideal would people similar guys english speaker slightly along give guys advice works still normalize situation imo works low key relying primarily immersion get language lessons people home low key immersion chat conversationally normal way italian english italian whenever possible say unnatural things like say pouring milk teathat language classes instructor partnerbut hes good low key get immersion people like language chat group language classes also good structured learning best language chat group overlap meeting people mentioned child get opol think thats acronym youll keep picking really big deal kid knows language youre great keep working italian sake pregnancy going involve baby brain probably later sleep deprivation also baby born bit emotional roller coaster firstmy spouse saying earth people think strange new parents get ppd crazymaking time husband needs get issue sorted soon preparation important things regret opol babyhood husband resisted teaching kids language finally motivated said kids least able right accent thats something relates hes bit better also struggles playing language teacher instead talkingi think continental thing

Notgoingtowrite,"I’m friends with three women in multilingual  marriages. Only one of them speaks both languages with her partner, and that’s because they both studied each other’s languages to a high level before they met. 

The other two women only speak in their native language because they find their partners to be way too judgmental/nitpicky when they make mistakes. I actually tutor one of the women in English, so I’ve seen how engaging and natural she can be in conversation! But she gets so nervous speaking around her husband that she’ll forget simple words, then he’ll immediately jump to correct her, which makes her feel embarrassed and stupid, then she’ll come to our next lesson and tell me in perfect English about it. It’s an emotional roller coaster. 

The other woman is married to a man who speaks a rare dialect of a language that already doesn’t have many resources, so the only way she would’ve been able to learn would be through her husband teaching her. That went about as well as you might think. He got impatient with all of her questions, didn’t know how to explain things, and they quickly decided this wouldn’t work well for them and he would just be her interpreter whenever they got together with his family or traveled to his home country. Their kids speak both languages - English is more dominant now that they’re in school, but they can communicate with grandparents and read simple books in their dad’s language. 

All of this to say…just because someone speaks a language, doesn’t mean they’re a good teacher (or a good teacher *for you*). The more pressure you feel, the more it will affect your confidence and the harder it will be for you to absorb new things and use what you’ve learned. It sounds like maybe you would benefit from a 1-on-1 conversational tutor. You know the words, you know a little grammar, now you need uninterrupted opportunities to *use them* in a low stress environment. 

You know your partner better than I do - can you think of a good way to gently tell him his attitude about your Italian skills is making it more difficult for you to get better, and you’re nervous to speak around him because you’re afraid of being judged for mistakes (which is then psyching you out and causing you to make even more mistakes)? It’s an awkward conversation but one worth having for sure. Language learning is all about small victories. Maybe together you can set some achievable goals, like “I will go to a bakery by myself and order 3 items”, “I will order something online without switching the language to English”, “I will ask my neighbor about their family”, or other daily tasks that would make your life easier if only you could speak in Italian.

(I could make more of an effort, it's true. I had a full time job then got made redundant and found out I was pregnant a few months ago, so it's been full on). I know there's a stereotype that English people are lazy, but I think it's more that we were never taught the skills at school to learn a language from a young age. And he gets more angry now I'm unemployed and we have a baby on the way, as I have to rely on him at doctor's appointments which embarrasses him. 
I know very basic things, I can get by in a shop and say some simple sentences. I can watch a film in Italian with Italian subtitles and get some context and understand some things. It's the retention of sentences and being able to express myself. A confidence issue, as well. I can't ""just speak Italian"" like he wants, because I don't know how to say many things. If I'm pouring milk in my tea, he'll ask me to describe what I'm doing but I get to guess tied because I don't know where to start",-1,1727723413.0,wonderful one thing remains issue gets angry takes personally im making much effort could could make effort true full time job got made redundant found pregnant months ago full know theres stereotype english people lazy think never taught skills school learn language young age gets angry im unemployed baby way rely doctors appointments embarrasses know basic things get shop say simple sentences watch film italian italian subtitles get context understand things retention sentences able express confidence issue well cant speak italian like wants dont know say many things im pouring milk tea hell ask describe im get guess tied dont know start
Thin-Dream-586,"I get that I am not doing well, and sometimes especially now I'm pregnant I do just default to english.

ResistSpecialist4826,Yes one day on one day off would be extremely confusing. It’s better for you both to speak in your native tongue anyway.,11,1727723829.0,yes one day one day would extremely confusing better speak native tongue anyway
ResistSpecialist4826,"I think you need to dial back his expectations and lay down the law on what is acceptable behavior from him before the baby comes and this gets worse. I’m a bit worked up on your behalf! I assume you are in Italy for him? As in he’s on his home turf while you are making all the changes and compromises- like taking a hit to your career and being away from family. If this is the case, he should be appreciative of your sacrifices and cheer you on as you learn. If he can’t do that- he honestly should just stay quiet and let you learn on your own.",14,1727725028.0,think need dial back expectations lay law acceptable behavior baby comes gets worse im bit worked behalf assume italy hes home turf making changes compromises like taking hit career away family case appreciative sacrifices cheer learn cant honestly stay quiet let learn
NonAbelianOwl,"> I have to rely on him at doctor's appointments which embarrasses him.

He's embarrassed?! He's embarrassed at having to help his partner, who is carrying his unborn child, at a doctor's?!!

overbyen,This also sounds kind of concerning for your kid. Kids need to learn a lot of things and make mistakes along the way. Is he going to get angry when your child is not learning something at the pace he wants? What if your child has a learning disability? What if you guys move to another country and the kid speaks English or another language better than Italian?,3,1727727215.0,also sounds kind concerning kid kids need learn lot things make mistakes along way going get angry child learning something pace wants child learning disability guys move another country kid speaks english another language better italian

Classic-Option4526,"You learn by positive practice. If, every time you try to practice you are shot down and criticized for not being good enough yet, you can’t learn. If, every time you ask for help trying to figure out where to start, he says no, then he is preventing you from learning. It’s well, documented that negative emotions around language learning make it harder. You keep saying you could be ‘doing more’ but how much more would you be doing if language learning made you feel loved and supported instead of criticized and guilty? Avoidance is a common way our brains react to stress, and stress makes retaining information harder.

Basically, your husband is sabotaging you every step of the way. It’s going to take years to get good at a new language. I really think you need to deal with this issue with your husband now (as in, finding some outside support to get him to stop this behavior and understand how he’s actually sabotaging you) before anything else. And, perhaps seek out friends or teachers in the language who are understanding and supportive, to start forming some positive associations.",10,1727724748.0,learn positive practice every time try practice shot criticized good enough yet cant learn every time ask help trying figure start says preventing learning well documented negative emotions around language learning make harder keep saying could much would language learning made feel loved supported instead criticized guilty avoidance common way brains react stress stress makes retaining information harder basically husband sabotaging every step way going take years get good new language really think need deal issue husband finding outside support get stop behavior understand hes actually sabotaging anything else perhaps seek friends teachers language understanding supportive start forming positive associations
Pwffin,"For many, it’s easier to not involve their partner in learning the partner’s language and just do it on your own, through classes, online courses, chat groups for learners etc. Your husband clearly has no idea what it takes to learn a new language as an adult and he’s not dealing with his frustrations in a good way and in that case it’s better to just not involve him at all. 

You’ve moved to a new country, you said you had been working full time until very recently and you are pregnant. All those things require time and mental effort that therefore cannot be used on language learning. For a frame of reference it can take 1-2 years for someone to become near-fluent/conversationally fluent - IF they spend all their time studying. As in it’s a full-time job AND a big part of their spare time is spent on it too. For many it takes several years, or even longer to get that good. You are actually doing really well to be able to do some/most of the A1 skills by now and you should be proud of that!",6,1727726143.0,many easier involve partner learning partners language classes online courses chat groups learners etc husband clearly idea takes learn new language adult hes dealing frustrations good way case better involve youve moved new country said working full time recently pregnant things require time mental effort therefore cannot used language learning frame reference take years someone become nearfluentconversationally fluent spend time studying fulltime job big part spare time spent many takes several years even longer get good actually really well able somemost skills proud
