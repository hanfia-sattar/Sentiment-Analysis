No-Count3834,"Yeah, the ps4 Pro had an ok launch. It did take 2 years before the OG PS4, you started to see the Pro be more preferable. Also 4k adoption was super high at the time. 8k not many seem to care, and is a super small majority. I’m on an LG Oled and the target audience of the PS5 Pro. But I just can’t pull the trigger. 

I did with the PS4 Pro 4 months in because of VR, and bought a 4k late 2017. Overall I feel I got a ton of value out of it, and if it died at the time would have bought another. 

This new PS5 Pro needs a good bit more time. I don’t see sell outs, but I feel once I can see more…like is it still a 32gbs hdmi bandwidth? Is 120hz mode still going to be a must for COD to run above 60fps? Or will VRR with PS5 Pro mode be 4:4:4 chroma normal. I have a lot more tech questions, I’m still waiting on. Also games…I don’t see any games coming up I’m buying show it off. 

I choose 120hz/vrr uncapped Fidelity variable 100% of the time. If you have the TV might as well, and it does great. If not on offer I do performance, and it’s great. I don’t think outside one game, have I played 30fps on PS5 base console. 

Also I looked at my disc PS4 collection and it’s big! Much more so than PS5, and some of those games I still revisit. I think the PS5 Pro will do the same or less, but after what hype is there dies down…hopefully we see a lot of games 2025-2028. It should get a good 3 1/2 to 4 years before PS6 if last gen is to go off of.

GameStop is doing $300 trade in if you buy from them. So I think come October pre order, certain retailers may sell well based on that. Currently Best Buy and others have poor offers.

schemeKC,"People who actually know what they're talking about absolutely are interested in the Pro. The jump from the PS5 to the PS5 Pro is a lot bigger than from the PS4 to the PS4 Pro.

The PS5 Pro has 292% more teraflops than the PS5 (~30 vs. 10.28), much more powerful ray tracing capability, and an extremely competent AI upscaler that will only get better over time. Hell - in terms of pure teraflops, the PS5 -> PS5 Pro is a bigger leap than from the PS4 to the PS5.

Having used DLSS extensively, I can say that PSSR is by far the most exciting thing to me about the PS5 Pro. The ability to get pretty-damn-close-to-as-good-as-native 4K rendering out of a target resolution of 1440p or even 1080p means dramatically more GPU power can allocated towards frame rate increases or scene complexity.

Everyone needs to rid themselves of the fallacy that people who want great graphics should only get PC.  Consoles were ahead of PC until the past decade.  And even then, the Pro is like 60% of the cost you'd pay to build a PC equivalent (that's been checked and verified, even if you cheap out on Mobo, ram, cooling, PSU).  And pre-builts charge a mark up rate for building them OR come with cheap parts prone to break (like PSU and MoBo) which makes it more expensive.

Just because you're a gamer who wants great fidelity doesn't mean you're also a PC enthusiast and PCs require time, knowledge, energy, more cost and space (for a setup because people don't typically whack a setup under their TV in the living room).

So, yes, the Pro is easily justifiable and great for their price and there's a market out there for people who know this.  You need to overcome that logical fallacy with regards to consoles, because it's just factually incorrect.",7,1727648157.0,graphics fps arent major concerns people playing videogames yeah thats enthusiast model biggest concern wouldnt playing console begin everyone needs rid fallacy people want great graphics get pc consoles ahead pc past decade even pro like cost youd pay build pc equivalent thats checked verified even cheap mobo ram cooling psu prebuilts charge mark rate building come cheap parts prone break like psu mobo makes expensive youre gamer wants great fidelity doesnt mean youre also pc enthusiast pcs require time knowledge energy cost space setup people dont typically whack setup tv living room yes pro easily justifiable great price theres market people know need overcome logical fallacy regards consoles factually incorrect,positive

tsukiko,"It only has to be online to authenticate and pair the drive to the console a *single time*. After that is done once, the console can't be offline indefinitely. It doesn't have to be online ever again after a successful pairing. I don't think you even need a PSN subscription to pair the drive, but IDK if you *just* need to have internet access or if you have to actually register it to an account? I have an OG PS5 with a non-detachable drive so I'm not sure about the exact particulars.

It's not ideal but I don't think that's the main issue. I find it worrying that there isn't even a convenient way to bundle the disc drive at the same when ordering—even if the components still came in completely separate boxes. If a future PlayStation console didn't support physical games that contain code for that hardware, I think I would skip the console entirely.

I usually buy more than one console, and have had every generation of PlayStation since the first and a PS4 Pro also. Physical games that you can actually *own copies* of is a huge reason why I still invest in the PS ecosystem.

lolKhamul,"What I NEVER understood is how games are often more expensive on 1st party digital shops like the Sony digital store than the disc version in retail.

The publisher saves a bundle by not having to print discs in a factory (multiple variants based on Region), buy millions of cases, pay for international shipping so discs are available globally, estimate sales to produce the right amount and so on. No need to give Retail stores a cut. Also there is the resell ""issue"" which they avoid entirely by selling digital. And there are even more smaller reasons like the ability to hold sales on a whim or profit off of spur of the moment decisions due to not being tied to opening times of retails stores. The list goes on and on.

From a publisher POV: Why not pass on a small percentage of those savings to the customer so they are encouraged to buy digital? Why not save a bundle? Why are they actively doing the opposite by making retail cheaper? 

I’m not trying to shill for companies, it’s great that PS customers still have the option. I just can’t figure out why Sony is actively working against themselves. Would it not make way more sense for Publishers to make digital the cheaper variant and make the customer pay extra for the benefits he gets from owning a disc  and offset the costs it creates to publish on disc?",2,1727682785.0,never understood games often expensive st party digital shops like sony digital store disc version retail publisher saves bundle print discs factory multiple variants based region buy millions cases pay international shipping discs available globally estimate sales produce right amount need give retail stores cut also resell issue avoid entirely selling digital even smaller reasons like ability hold sales whim profit spur moment decisions due tied opening times retails stores list goes publisher pov pass small percentage savings customer encouraged buy digital save bundle actively opposite making retail cheaper im trying shill companies great ps customers still option cant figure sony actively working would make way sense publishers make digital cheaper variant make customer pay extra benefits gets owning disc offset costs creates publish disc,positive

Most Sony first-party games are at 40% digital sales.

Of course, overall sales will skew toward digital immensely because the vast majority of games released on PS systems now are small indie games that never get physical releases (maybe apart from the occasional LRG release, but those are too niche to change the figure significantly).

The person I'm responding to misused the term scalping. Not defending anything, really. Again, you can make the case that pro pricing is too high for you, personally. No problems there. And no disc drive is super lame.
