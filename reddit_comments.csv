ResistSpecialist4826,"May I suggest that your husband is not helping things and is likely part of the reason you aren’t learning more. It’s hard to enjoy learning and retain info and practice the language with someone breathing down your neck telling you how dissatisfied they are with you and how frustrating your lack of abilities are. 
As for your child, so long as you speak to them in English and they go to nursery and school in Italian they will automatically be bilingual. If your husband starts insisting on only Italian in the home— then you might have issues.",35,1727722255.0
Master-Annual5701,To be honest the bigger problem is how your husband is putting pressure on you especially when you're pregnant. It's much worse than not speaking Italian yet.,13,1727723090.0
MusParvum,"Watch and listen to stuff that is fully in Italian but geared towards beginners, like the Super Easy playlist on the Easy Italian YouTube channel: [https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLw\_3OGi3pBv735a2Y\_pp76tvIIhSEyRu1](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLw_3OGi3pBv735a2Y_pp76tvIIhSEyRu1)

Find as much material as you can like that, and listen to it as much as possible, at least an hour or so every single day.

Find a self-paced course, like Busuu or Assimil and do at least a couple of lessons every single day. Get a tutor on iTalki or Preply and do at least one lesson a week. Find an Italian-language subreddit or message board about a topic you're interested in and read and post there every day.

Do as many of those things as you can, every single day, no matter what.",8,1727721790.0
ohboop,"Academics are starting to talk about the possibility of something called an ""affective filter"". Basically the idea, as I understand it, is that our brains have a *really* hard time learning a new language when we're stressed out or otherwise feeling negative about it. I wouldn't be surprised if your brain is having this issue, based on what you've described here.


That being said, I think it would really help to build up some positive experiences for yourself. Start with some things you think you could accomplish more or less easily. Maybe a journal where you write a few sentences each day along the lines of ""I like coffee. Today the weather is rainy."" Keep it basic, and focus on being happy with what you can do, not upset about what you can't. Read, watch and listen to things that you can understand easily, and focus on the positive feelings of being able to understand, *not* on things like, ""this is below where I should be"".


Besides that, I would recommend trying to find some structure you can follow. It sounds like your class was a positive experience. If taking another class is not an option, what about something self-paced, like assimil, Pimsleur, or another course book? Pimsleur in particular is focused on getting you to listen and respond automatically. They go slowly and reviews are built in to each successive lesson, so it could be a great course for you.


Lastly, you need to communicate with your partner that his attitude towards your learning is upsetting for you, and it can make it hard to keep trying. Ask if he would be open to working together on how he can support you. ""I like it when you do X"" or ""it makes me feel bad when you say things like Y"". Positive feedback is a much better motivator than negative, which tends to demoralize and demotivate people.",7,1727725288.0
bearlyepic,"I think both you and your husband need to give you some grace. You haven't even been learning for a full calendar year AND you are pregnant.  Fatigue and brain fog aka ""pregnancy brain"" are a classic part of growing a human and they make retaining information difficult. 


I would say keep practicing your output for sure, but I would hire a teacher on Italki or something similar. Teaching is a skill, and it clear that trying to teach you is clearly stressing your husband and your relationship. ",4,1727724220.0
LucreziaD,"Ok, I am native speaker of Italian and I have several foreign languages under my belt. First, struggling to learn a language doesn't mean to be a failure.

Please keep in mind these things:

* learning a language requires a lot of time. Fluency requires hundreds of hours of structured learning and even more of exposure to the language. Yes, some people are faster than others, but especially if you have never learned a foreign language before it requires extra time.
* Passive abilities (reading and then listening) usually develop before active ones (speaking and writing). So again, perfectly normal that you struggle. 
* Level A1 is basic survival level: how not to die of hunger and thirst if you are stranded in Italy with nobody who speaks English. If you want to be able to have a normal conversation, you need to take classes up to level B1 for  everyday interactions, and B2 for more complex interactions. C1 is the level where you can talk about anything with little effort. So yes, one A1 curse is not going to solve your problem unfortunately.
* Your partner acting like a dick when you are trying to speak is the most stupid thing ever. Teaching a language requires a lot of patience and encouragement. Becoming impatient and making you feel stupid isn't helping anyone.

Then I don't know you and your learning styles, but I can tell you what tricks were useful for me. Maybe some will be useful to you too.

* Going full immersion. Set your phone, your tablet, your computer to Italian. All social medias, podcasts, tv, newspapers, books, music, etc, all should be in Italian. No English media at all. Surround yourself with Italian and Italian only. Just get a good italian-english dictionary for when you can't figure out the meaning of words. 
* Children's books. Reading is always easier than listening. Children's books are especially easy and cover the basic everyday language. Go to your local library and start from the books for the youngest (the ones soon you will start showing to your baby) and read your way from there. 
* Grammar. This I know is a controversial topic, but Italian is a much richly inflected language than English (especially the verbs). A good grammar with exercises (a paper book) can be a very useful tool. Learning the grammar of a language teaches you its structure. Knowing the structure makes parsing written sentences easier.   Better reading skill help you improving your vocabulary, making recognizing word boundaries when people speak easier. Better understanding of conversations will, after enough input, make it easier for you to formulate full sentences.
* If you can get a tutor, working on the sounds of a language and how to correctly articulate them is really useful.  For instance to articulate the Italian t, you need to put the tip of your tongue in a different position than to articulate an English t. If it isn't possible, there are books and youtube videos with this kind of explanations. 
* Look if you can do some kind of exchange language activity, like finding Italians who want to practice speaking in English in exchange of them helping you practice speaking Italian. Since you are both learning it can be a less stressful environment than trying to talk to strangers in a shop or with your partner.",4,1727725206.0
9peppe,"Your child will be just fine and they'll speak both languages as long as you expose them to both.

You probably need to find better resources. There's not much L2 Italian education outside of universities (for incoming Erasmus students, and that caps out at B2, I think).

What language do you speak at home? Italian is not an easy language and it needs lots of practice. You probably should try speak Italian with your husband and English with your child, if you can.",3,1727721096.0
justHoma,"How I plan to teach European languages: 

- Use Anki for cards: n+1 sentence or tl(target language)/nl(native language) (or explanation if level allows)   
- Spend time learning key differences from the nl, for example in Italian first thing is 3 golden tenses (same as in English), and then it can be easily scaled on others. [https://ankiweb.net/](https://ankiweb.net/)  
- Read read read, a lot of people don't know how powerful this activity is, especially if you read out loud. Something that you want to say comes to your mind, and lots of times main construction is correct. Use lingq to be able to read advanced things without caring about words (I usually read Harry Potter and Methods of Rationality). For example in when I read it in Italian it has so much new words per page that I would read with speed of 5-7 words/minute if I googled each of them, instead, I read 40/minute.   
- When you have enough skill create a channel with just tl, the main point is to get listening fluency as fast as possible. I recommend choosing one topic and watch only channels that talk about it. This way you'll be able to get fluent really fast in this one field and scaling on other fields will be a breath.   
- Speaking. One of the easiest ways is to create an Anki deck for sentences you said wrong, if you said ""Io vivo nell Roma"" or something like that, just create card ""Io vivo a Roma"", and on the front page write ""I live in Rome"", after some time you'll start saying ""a"" for same cases (also you can include rule on the back on this card as well ""use a with cities"").

When you are making a program for yourself it should be balanced, interesting, and sure for your goals. 

For example, my method of learning Japanese might seem strange ""why would he learn so much grammar before and do only one hour of immersion a day"" but in reality I just have chosen to follow a challenge, where I can track my results and because of it I can stay motivated. Or Italian, where I just read because I don't want to do anything else and also want to test how exactly  it will work out. 

If you have some interest, you can dm me and maybe I'll create program for you) My motivation is whatever I do I should find a student after reaching some point, to see if my theories and methods are correct not just for me.",3,1727723110.0
Wild_Honeysuckle,"Are you taking lessons? You need to find a space to practice speaking (and listening etc) with someone patient, who can help teach you. That’s not your husband. 

Others have put forward good ideas. Personally, I quite like https://www.babbel.com/live. You can have as many live online video lessons as you like for a fixed price. If you’re willing to put the time in and take lots of lessons, the cost would be very reasonable. I quite like the group lessons, with up to 6 in a class, mostly because I don’t have to work as hard! Plus I quite like meeting a bunch of random people. But given you have a strong motivation to learn, you probably want to consider the private lessons. You’d get lots of practice at speaking, and would learn really quickly, I suspect. There’s also the Babbel app, with lessons that work well for my learning style. I find the app teaches me words and grammar, and the live lessons allow me to practice, and to learn to actually speak. It can all be done from home, which would help if your baby is due to arrive soon. 

Beyond that… I had a quick look at your previous posts. Your husband is 10 years older than you, and honestly sounds a bit nasty, at least on occasions. You’ve moved to his country away from your friends and family, I would guess. You have a baby on the way, which will be stressful (and delightful). There are some pretty serious red flags here. Please make sure you look after yourself, and keep in touch with your friends and family back home. If you can make new friends, then all the better. 

Wishing you all the best!",2,1727728914.0
Sle,"Michel Thomas' audio course taught me shitloads of Italian in the space of two weeks. Give that a try, you've nothing to lose.",1,1727727272.0
iamnogoodatthis,"Your partner is probably your single biggest obstacle to learning Italian, when he could be your single biggest help. Once you've learned some simple vocabulary and grammar, the best way to learn is just to speak - and a big challenge of language learning is getting over the hump of being scared to just to say whatever you can cobble together even if you know it's not quite right. He is making this a pressurised, scary experience for you, which is exactly the opposite of what you need to actually learn anything. I'm sorry he's like this.

Taking a step back, why did you both move to Italy when you spoke not a word of Italian if he wasn't OK with that situation? He's an idiot if he was living in some fantasy whereby you'd just jump immediately to upper-intermediate fluency in a few months. Yes you \*can\* advance that quickly if you treat it like a full time job, but... well, realistically, who is going to do that?",1,1727728933.0
oeiei,"You guys need some friends who are in a similar boat so that he can feel like the situation is normal. Sometimes we get partners that are such conformists, and they need a little help. Ideal would be people who are similar to you guys but the English speaker is *slightly* further along so that they can give you guys advice on what works, but still normalize the situation.

IMO what works is being low key and relying primarily on immersion. You get your language lessons from other people, but at home it's low key immersion. (He should chat conversationally in a normal way in both Italian and English with you, just Italian whenever possible, but not say unnatural things like ""How do you say 'I am pouring milk in my tea?'""--that is for your language classes, he is not an instructor he is your partner.)But if he's not good at being low key about that, get your immersion from other people like a language chat group. Language classes are also good for structured learning, but both are best. Language chat group can overlap with meeting people as mentioned above.

Your child should get OPOL (I think that's the acronym). You'll keep picking it up. It's really not a big deal if your kid knows a language that you're not great at, just keep working at Italian for your own sake.

Pregnancy is going to involve baby brain and probably later sleep deprivation. Also once the baby is born, it's a bit of an emotional roller coaster at first--My spouse and I were both saying ""Why on earth do people think it's strange that new parents get PPD, this is a crazy-making time!"" so, your husband needs to get this issue sorted out for himself very soon in preparation for more important things.

I regret not doing OPOL from babyhood with my husband who resisted teaching our kids his language. Finally now he is motivated because I said our kids should at least be able to have the right accent, and that's something he relates to, so he's doing a bit better. He also struggles with not playing language teacher and instead just talking--I think it's a continental thing.",1,1727729338.0
NonAbelianOwl,">I'm also pregnant and want our baby to be bilingual, and am really scared I'll not be able to understand my child...

Please don't worry about this. First, if you speak English to your child, they'll learn English (especially if you're the primary caregiver). Second, it'll be a couple of years before your child is able to speak even basic sentences (think ""me want apple""), so you have time to learn!

Also, Italian is a difficult language to learn, and about the only thing that could make it harder is a belittling, demanding, unempathetic, and unsupportive partner.",1,1727729497.0

Thin-Dream-586,"I think so too. For example, i have been trying to be better, yesterday i spoke in some kind of English-Italian hybrid where i said the words/phrases i knew in Italian, but filled the gaps with English. And i was reading signs on shops/things we saw that i knew the words of. 
He then spoke a sentence fully in Italian, and i couldn't understand it - which made him so angry and remind me of my lack of progress and then i (pathetically maybe) just didn't want to bother again.

ciegulls,"Thank you for sharing that academic term! I’ve been trying to figure it out within myself basically. I really like languages and learning them, but as soon as I’ve been in an “adult immersive” environment, like needing to use this to find employment or get my actual needs met like health or housing or whatever, I start to despise the language… I don’t feel good because I’m stresses because I need to accomplish this certain goal and it’s no longer a fun practice exercise for me and it’s such a struggle on both sides that I don’t feel positive rewards from it. Whereas I have learned a language before through immersion to relative fluency, but the learning process was incredibly positive and rarely stressful because I didn’t have to worry much about the real-life factors. I’ve been wanting to learn more about this as a phenomena so I can try to maybe find some solutions or work arounds for myself, so have a key word like this really helps.",2,1727728482.0

Notgoingtowrite,"I’m friends with three women in multilingual  marriages. Only one of them speaks both languages with her partner, and that’s because they both studied each other’s languages to a high level before they met. 

The other two women only speak in their native language because they find their partners to be way too judgmental/nitpicky when they make mistakes. I actually tutor one of the women in English, so I’ve seen how engaging and natural she can be in conversation! But she gets so nervous speaking around her husband that she’ll forget simple words, then he’ll immediately jump to correct her, which makes her feel embarrassed and stupid, then she’ll come to our next lesson and tell me in perfect English about it. It’s an emotional roller coaster. 

The other woman is married to a man who speaks a rare dialect of a language that already doesn’t have many resources, so the only way she would’ve been able to learn would be through her husband teaching her. That went about as well as you might think. He got impatient with all of her questions, didn’t know how to explain things, and they quickly decided this wouldn’t work well for them and he would just be her interpreter whenever they got together with his family or traveled to his home country. Their kids speak both languages - English is more dominant now that they’re in school, but they can communicate with grandparents and read simple books in their dad’s language. 

All of this to say…just because someone speaks a language, doesn’t mean they’re a good teacher (or a good teacher *for you*). The more pressure you feel, the more it will affect your confidence and the harder it will be for you to absorb new things and use what you’ve learned. It sounds like maybe you would benefit from a 1-on-1 conversational tutor. You know the words, you know a little grammar, now you need uninterrupted opportunities to *use them* in a low stress environment. 

You know your partner better than I do - can you think of a good way to gently tell him his attitude about your Italian skills is making it more difficult for you to get better, and you’re nervous to speak around him because you’re afraid of being judged for mistakes (which is then psyching you out and causing you to make even more mistakes)? It’s an awkward conversation but one worth having for sure. Language learning is all about small victories. Maybe together you can set some achievable goals, like “I will go to a bakery by myself and order 3 items”, “I will order something online without switching the language to English”, “I will ask my neighbor about their family”, or other daily tasks that would make your life easier if only you could speak in Italian. It gives you something specific to study and practice as well as a measurable goal that you can both celebrate.",1,1727729423.0

Classic-Option4526,"You learn by positive practice. If, every time you try to practice you are shot down and criticized for not being good enough yet, you can’t learn. If, every time you ask for help trying to figure out where to start, he says no, then he is preventing you from learning. It’s well, documented that negative emotions around language learning make it harder. You keep saying you could be ‘doing more’ but how much more would you be doing if language learning made you feel loved and supported instead of criticized and guilty? Avoidance is a common way our brains react to stress, and stress makes retaining information harder.

Basically, your husband is sabotaging you every step of the way. It’s going to take years to get good at a new language. I really think you need to deal with this issue with your husband now (as in, finding some outside support to get him to stop this behavior and understand how he’s actually sabotaging you) before anything else. And, perhaps seek out friends or teachers in the language who are understanding and supportive, to start forming some positive associations.",10,1727724748.0

You’ve moved to a new country, you said you had been working full time until very recently and you are pregnant. All those things require time and mental effort that therefore cannot be used on language learning. For a frame of reference it can take 1-2 years for someone to become near-fluent/conversationally fluent - IF they spend all their time studying. As in it’s a full-time job AND a big part of their spare time is spent on it too. For many it takes several years, or even longer to get that good.
